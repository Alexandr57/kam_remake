Mission 6 problems:
on Discord: @Ithaka said he will report the issues, if find any
reported by @DDDDestroyer on Discord:
you have to do some hardcore cheesing to win it because the AI begins attacking at like 15 or 20 minutes?
i beat it by making sure my knight is always fed, setting up a killzone at the 1-2 tile wide path through the hills (western edge of the allied village) and continuously baiting out the enemy garrison unit by unit with one crossbowman
and speeding construction to get out a few extra melee units around 45 minutes
so that i could hold off the attacks from the second village which were going for the coal supply

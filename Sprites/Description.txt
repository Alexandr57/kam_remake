This folder contains replacement images for original KaM sprites.
In order to replace some sprite you should name it in following format:

#_####.png - main graphic
#_####.txt - offset information, 2 lines, X and Y offset in pixels
#_####a.png - player color mask area

First digit is RX library index. Second array of 4 digits is sprite index.
For example to replace main menu logo use: 5_0004.png

Images whose indexes are outside of original ranges will be ignored.
